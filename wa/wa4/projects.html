    <p>
I used object oriented programming to create a Lion King themed board game using C++. Specifics about the game include the ability to save points throughout, 
the ability to choose which player and mentor you want to play with and more.

    <h3 tabindex="7">3D home design</h3>
    <p>
I helped my uncle design his house which he built last year in Moscow Idaho using Fusion360 modeling software. Included a symetric design and chosing materials that would 
last in the cold winter climate. The home has began construction and is going well.
